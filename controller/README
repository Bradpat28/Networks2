CPE 465 Project 2 Milestone 1

Overall I tested this on a multi switch configuration, and everything seemed to work fine

When transfering the code from my mac (where I did development) to the unix computer, 
the unix compiler wouldnt support the ntohll() endianess calls. 
Though functionality shouldn't be hindered, printing of fields, specifically the multipart packet, may be off.
